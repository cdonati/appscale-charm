* When running in a local lxc environment, appscale is accessible before `juju expose appscale` is run. I don't think this is supposed to happen. Running `juju expose` actually renders the instance inaccessible from a browser.
* I don't think the current method of directly accessing EC2 metadata (if available) is the best way of obtaining the instance's public and private IP addresses for the AppScalefile. `juju charm proof` warns about doing this, and in a local environment, curl needs to time out before failing to retrieve the metadata.
  * I was hoping the charmhelpers python library could provide these values for me, and it looks like it uses the cli tool `unit-get` to retrieve the unit's private address. However, even after installing `juju` on the unit, I was unable to get this command to work.
